# Home-Ops 🏠

A modular, secure Docker Compose stack for self-hosting applications and infrastructure. This project uses Traefik as a reverse proxy with automated SSL and focuses heavily on container security principles, including least privilege, non-root execution, and read-only filesystems.

## 📂 Project Structure

The stack is modular, splitting services into logical domains:

```

## 🚀 Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose plugin installed.
* `apache2-utils` (or equivalent) for generating `htpasswd` hashes.
* A configured domain and relevant API tokens (e.g., Gandi) if utilizing the default DNS challenge setup.
* UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) enabled on the host machine.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

1. **Configure the Environment**

    Copy the example environment file and fill in your domains, passwords, and tokens.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    nano .env
    ```

2. **Generate Traefik Credentials**

    Generate a password hash for the Traefik dashboard. Replace `admin` with your preferred username.
    ```bash
    htpasswd -nB admin
    ```

    Copy the output and paste it into the `TRAEFIK_DASHBOARD_CREDENTIALS` variable in your `.env` file. Ensure you escape any `$` symbols by doubling them (e.g., `$$`).

3. **Secure Configuration Files**

    Restrict permissions on your environment file to protect sensitive data.
    ```bash
    chmod 600 .env
    ```

4. **Configure Firewall (UFW)**

    To secure the host architecture under a **Least-Privilege** model, local core services (DNS, UPnP) are locked down to the private LAN, while the Traefik reverse proxy handles all external routing without exposing backend ports directly.

    Run the following commands to apply the hardened firewall profile:

    ```bash
    # Allows the proxy container (from Docker bridge) to reach the host network interface
    sudo ufw allow in from 172.16.0.0/12 to 172.17.0.1 port 8123 proto tcp comment 'Allow Traefik to Host Home Assistant'

    # Allows global devices to access your web apps securely via HTTP/S over IPv4 and IPv6
    sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80 comment 'Traefik: Global HTTP'
    sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 443 comment 'Traefik: Global HTTPS'

    # IPv6 Link-Local rule is critical to prevent multi-second website lookup latencies (Happy Eyeballs timeouts)
    sudo ufw allow from <LAN_IPV4_SUBNET> to <HOST_LAN_IPV4> port 53 proto udp comment 'Pi-hole: LAN IPv4 DNS (UDP)'
    sudo ufw allow from <LAN_IPV4_SUBNET> to <HOST_LAN_IPV4> port 53 proto tcp comment 'Pi-hole: LAN IPv4 DNS (TCP)'
    sudo ufw allow from fe80::/10 to <HOST_IPV6_LINK_LOCAL> port 53 proto udp comment 'Pi-hole: LAN IPv6 Link-Local DNS (UDP)'
    sudo ufw allow from fe80::/10 to <HOST_IPV6_LINK_LOCAL> port 53 proto tcp comment 'Pi-hole: LAN IPv6 Link-Local DNS (TCP)'

    # Standardized global network definitions for multicast routing and device discovery
    sudo ufw allow in proto igmp to any comment 'UPnP: Allow IGMP Multicast Tracking'
    sudo ufw allow in proto udp to 239.255.255.250 port 1900 comment 'UPnP: Allow SSDP Multicast Discovery'

    # Subnet-wide rule allowing local smart home gateways and IoT devices to respond to UPnP/APIs
    sudo ufw allow in proto udp from <LAN_IPV4_SUBNET> port 1900 to <HOST_LAN_IPV4> port 1900 comment 'UPnP: LAN UDP Discovery Responses'
    sudo ufw allow in proto tcp from <LAN_IPV4_SUBNET> to <HOST_LAN_IPV4> port 30000:40000 comment 'UPnP: LAN TCP Push / TR-064 APIs'
    ```

    *Note: `172.16.0.0/12` is the standard private IP block Docker uses for bridge networks. `172.17.0.1` represents the default Docker gateway on the host.*

    Apply Changes:

    ```bash
    sudo ufw reload
    ```

4. **Start the Stack**

    Initialize and run all services in the background. The setup uses init-containers to automatically handle directory permissions and initial database setups.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## 💾 Backup and Restore

The repository includes a `data-manager.sh` script to handle cold backups. This script safely stops the containers, archives all dynamically found `data` directories (and the `.env` file) to ensure database consistency, and then restarts the stack.

**Note:** The script must be run as root to preserve correct file ownership and permissions.

### Preparation

Make the script executable (Run Once):

```bash
chmod +x data-manager.sh
```

### Create a Backup

To create a backup archive in a specified destination directory:

```bash
sudo ./data-manager.sh backup /path/to/backup/destination
```

### Restore from a Backup

To restore data from an existing .tar.gz archive (this will overwrite current data):

```bash
sudo ./data-manager.sh restore /path/to/backup/archive/home-ops-backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.tar.gz
```
